# Predictions on bike sharing demand

## Description

The motivation is to make a predictions where the current existing app such as CityMapper or Google map currently do not support. Providing predictive figure, which we are aiming in the project, would result reduce of making such error where the current 
application are limited. 

Objective for this project is to build multiple machine learning models to predict and analysis the bike sharing demand in London. Data modification, machine learning model construction, visualisation of data are main objectives in this project, and further analysis on each
of the performance of the model will be carried forward.


## Getting Started

### Data Set

* TFL data set link: https://cycling.data.tfl.gov.uk/

The data in period of 1st of April in 2016 to 1st of November in 2016 is used in this project.
It is recommanded to download _2016TripDataZip.zip_ file first and download rest of the _.csv_ file from _04JourneyDataExtract01Apr2016-30Apr2016.csv_ to _29JourneyDataExtract26Oct2016-01Nov2016.csv_

* UCL data set link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset

* Docking station data set link:

Having these following _.csv_ files must be located in the same directory as the python script, in this case _.ipynb_ file. For example, if one of the jupyter notebook file was in the Desktop, all of the .csv files need to be saved in Desktop.
